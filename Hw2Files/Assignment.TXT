Following on the success of homework 1, your mother has asked you to augment your tag sale price
recording program to save all of the data to files. She noticed that if you close the program around
lunchtime, all of the sales data is lost. She wants it to be permanent.
Change your program from homework 1 to do two new things
• Upon opening the program, load data from a file (name the file whatever you want) into the
array in which you store prices. Update the statistics in the GUI using the loaded data.
• Continue to run the program normally while collecting data…
• Before closing the program, write all of the collected data to the file. If you already loaded all
data from the file into the array when you started the program, then all of that data and the
new data collected should be in the array. Overwrite the existing file with the new data
