You are tasked with keeping track of sales at a tag sale. Youâ€™re mother has decided to clean the house,
hold a tag sale, and has asked you to be responsible for keeping track of how much money is taken in
from the tag sale.
Create a VB application to track the prices of items sold at the tag sale. Your application should have an
input box, in which the user will enter the price of an item, and a button to submit the price. There will
also be 3 labels (or text boxes) to display statistics about the sales: TotalSales, AverageSalePrice,
TotalItems.
TotalSales is the total amount of money collected, TotalItems is the total number of items sold, and
AverageSalePrice is the TotalSales/TotalItems.
Your program should store each price in an array, from which you will calculate and display the
statistics. The stats should be updated each time the user enters a new sale.
