Following on the success of homework 2, your mother wants you to augment the tag sale price tracking
program. In addition to storing the price of each item sold, she wants to store the name of the item sold.
Create a class called TagSaleItem, with the following variables (properties) and Get/Set members
(functions)
Double itemPrice
String itemName
Add a textbox to your form to input the name of the item at the same time as the price.
The previous program used an array to store a list of prices. It would be awesome if this program used
an array of objects to store a list of items… but we’ll get to that in a later assignment. For now the
assignment is just to create a class and a single object and demonstrate how to use it (using the Get/Set
methods)
